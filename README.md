# Real time face mask detection in Android 

The recent coronavirus pandemic has pushed people around the world to new challenges. In this context of uncertainty, we can all play our role by contributing to the fight against this disease. This is an excellent opportunity to put technology at the service of humanity. From my place I could try to contribute with the tools that I can work on. So here I've developed an application to detect face masks in the smartphone. This application works in real time. The application identifies whether people seen by the phone's camera are wearing a face mask or not.
